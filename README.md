SplitTag for CodeRush 
===========

This plugin adds a new CodeProvider (**Split Tag**). 

The new CodeProvider will operates from the content of a HTML or XML tag. 

It breaks the context of the tag into 2 pieces at the caret, and places the 2nd of these pieces in a new tag following the existing one.
